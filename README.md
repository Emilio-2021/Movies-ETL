# Movies-ETL

Amazing Prime is the world's largest online streaming movies, TV shows online retailer. The Amazing Prime video team would like to develop and algorithm that will predict which low budget movies is being released will become popular so they can buy the streaming rights at a bargain.

To inspire the team have some fun, and connect with the local recording community, Amazing Prime has decided to sponsor a hackathon, providing a clean set of movie data and asking participants to predict popular pictures. In data analysis, a hackathon is an event where teams of analysts collaborate to work intensively on a project, using data to solve a problem. Hackathons generally last several days and teams work around the clock on their projects.

By a member of the Amazing Prime team, we have been tasked with creating the dataset for the hacketon. There are two data sources. A scraping Wikipedia from movies released since 1990 and rating data from Movie Land's website, Kaggle.

Using Python language through Jupyter Notebook, we will extract data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle files, clean and then combine them, and finally save them into a SQL database to be later stored in the cloud so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use.
